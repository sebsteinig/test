More advanced tools include things like Jupyter Notebooks and IDEs like Spyder or Visual Studio Code.\n",

The easiest way to get access to JupyterLab is to [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) which is a piece of software which includes Python along with lots of other tools. It is freely available for Windows, MacOS and Linux.\n",

You can also install it on your personal laptop and follow the course on it. If you are working on a loan laptop, Anaconda can be installed into your home area, so you will not need any special permissions. Once Anaconda is installed, start \"Anaconda Navigator\" and press the JupyterLab button on the main screen:\n",
